# What did I learn in this course?

This course has provided me a broad introduction to

- machine learning 
- datamining
- statistical pattern recognition. 

Topics include: 
- (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). 
- (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). 
- (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).
